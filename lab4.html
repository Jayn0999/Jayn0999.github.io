                <ul>
                    <li>1 cup white or cider vinegar</li>
                    <li>1 cup water <br></li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons peeled and crushed garlic</li>  
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li> 
                    <li>3 bay leaves</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                    <li>3 pounds of chicken (large pieces or hacked small)</li>
                    <li>2 1/2 pounds pork butt cut into 1/2 inch cubes</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons peanut oil (optional)</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup of red wine (optional) </li>
                    <li>hot sauce or dried hot peppers (optional)</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup to 1 full cup of brown sugar (optional)</li>   
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <i style="font-family:Helvetica;">Variation:</i>Some latin countries have an almost identical recipe, except they add the optional ingredients: red wine, hot sauce, and brown sugar. These are not traditional additions in the philippines. <br> <br>
                    You can use either your favorite chicken pieces (thighs and legs are frequently used)or "hack" one whole chiken. Hacking refers to cutting a whole chicken into small pieces with the bone still in. Leaving the bone in the pieces helps to retain moisrure and shape. You do not want to make this dish with boneless chicken. <br> <br>
                    In a large pot bring to a boil the vinegar, water, garlic, salt, bay leaves hot pepper, and black pepper. Add the cut up meat cover with the brown  suger and once again bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer covered for 30 minutes. Add the soy sauce and the wine and cook an additional  10 minutes. <br> <br>
                    Remove the meat and continue cooking the sauce until it is reduced by half. <br> <br>
                    <i style="font-family:Helvetica;">Optional:</i> while the sauce continues to cook, you may want to brown the chicken and pork pieces in a hot skillet with the peanut oil. If you used large chicken pieces (ie leg quarters) skip this step.<br><br><br><br>
